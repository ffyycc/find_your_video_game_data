# Find Your Video Game
## Graph Visualization for Games in Different Platforms

This repo shares my data to create [Find Your Video Game](https://videogamevisual.com/) website.

All data are from [GameFAQs](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/), and I will update the data periodically.

I use **D3.js** to create most part of my website and use **google firebase** as the database. Below are some examples and instructions about what you can do on this web.

### Examples
#### PC

#### Nintendo Switch

### Mouse Over And Search
You can put your mouse on the single plot to show detailed information.
Here, I select the point for the popular game "Super Smash Bros"

If you can't find your game, you can always search in the search bar. The search box will give you the similar game names.

Then you can click search, it would have a success message if success.

Click 'reset' button to clear all highlighted games.

If your searched game not in the current graph, it will show some similar games. You can click the game you want.
